        <p>- My apologies about the site going through so many changes recently, ive been trying to (hopefully) finalize the modpack. A major change that I am looking at undertaking is the switch to a more recent multiplayer mod: Luna MultiPlayer (LMP). At this point, the old multiplayer client the server was using (Dark MultiPlayer/DMP) was just being recompiled for new versions of KSP- It was no longer being actively worked on. LMP is new (relatively) on the scene and adds many new features that DMP lacked, such as UDP network messages and stuff. if you so wish, you can check out the release thread <a href="https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/168271-131-luna-multiplayer-lmp-alpha/">here</a>. Just be aware that as this is very new, it is seeing a lot of active development and so a lot of changes are happening very regularly. (posted 12/11/2017)</p>

        <p>- Hey all, this is the initial announcement for this site. I decided to put this up before the actual server goes online in order to give people time to get their install set up and everything. Barring any unexpected delays, the server should be ready to go online on or before December 20th, 2017. (posted 12/7/2017)</p>
