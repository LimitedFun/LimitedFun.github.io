        <pre>
Step 1: Install KSP and run it at least once.
	-make sure that your game and graphics settings are the way you want them.
	
Step 2: Locate your KSP install directory.
	-This is located wherever you told the install dialogue to put it
	-The filetree should look something like this:
		../Kerbal Space Program
			../GameData
			../Internals
			../KSP_Data
			...And so on and so forth.
            
	-The key folder here is that GameData folder- this is where you will be putting all 
          your mod files.
	-The layout of a KSP mod's folder is generally the same:
		../ModName.zip
			../ModName
				../GameData
					../ModName
						../Mod files
                        
        -Some common mod directory examples are included below, from most common
        to least common.
      
          Layout 1:
            ../ModName.zip
                ../GameData
                    ../ModName
                        ../Mod files
                    ../Extra files, licences, and readmes

          Layout 2:
            ../ModName.zip
                ../ModName or something similar
                    ../GameData
                        ../ModName
                            ../Mod files
                        ../Extra files, licences, and readmes

           Layout 3: 
            ../ModName.zip
                ../ModName
                    ../Mod files
                ../Extra files, licences, and readmes
        
        -Basically, you are looking for a ../GameData folder contained within the archive,
          and are merging the contained items into your ../GameData file.
        -In the case of Layout 3 above, you would move the ModName file directly into
          your ../GameData directory.
        
Step 3: Start getting the required mods.
	-Specific links and install instructions are provided below.
    
Step 4: connecting to the server
    -Launch the game
    -Accept any EULAs that pop up for Dark MultiPlayer (DMP)
    -You can close out the KSP-AVC dialogue if it doesnt come up with any options to 
      update mods.
    -Once KSP loads to the main menu, go to the DMP window and add a new server.
    -You can name it whatever, but make sure that the IP is set to the "Current Server IP"
      displayed at the top-left of this website.
    -The default port needs to be changed to 8800.
    -Make sure to select a username and color that you want before joining.
    -Have fun!
